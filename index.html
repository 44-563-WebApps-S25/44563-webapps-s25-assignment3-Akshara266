    <h3>Favorite Food: Paneer Butter Masala</h3>
    <p>I love <strong>Paneer Butter Masala</strong> because of its rich,<strong>creamy texture</strong> and the perfect balance of spices. 
    Itâ€™s a delicious North Indian dish made with soft paneer cubes cooked in a flavorful tomato-based gravy, 
    blended with butter and cream. It pairs perfectly with naan or jeera rice, making every meal satisfying!</p>
